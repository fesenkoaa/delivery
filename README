PROBLEM CASES IN THE SOLUTION:

1) CASE: data is empty.
    to make app to work we need:
        1. use term -> create initial superuser (createsuperuser) (or just user) (model User)
        2. login to admin dashboard -> create customer (models Customer)
                + at least one product (dish) (instance of Product)
        3. use shell -> create variable with user, customer, product, cart, cartproduct:

            >>> user1 = User.objects.first()

            >>> customer1 = Customer.objects.first() or, if not exists:
                    customer = Customer.objects.create(user=user1)

            >>> product1 = model.objects.get(id=1)  ->  (models == MainDishes, Salads, Drinks, Sous, Additives)

            >>> cart1 = Cart.objects.create(owner=customer1)

            >>> cp = CartProduct.objects.create(user=customer1,
                                                cart=cart1,
                                                content_object=product1,
                                                total_price=product1.price)

            >>> cart.products.add(cp)


        INITIAL CART WAS CREATED WITH ID=1, NEXT CART WILL CREATE AUTOMATE USING APP


2) CASE: setting of telegram bot:
    if tg bot doesn't work, we have to connect the new:
        1. using BotFather (bot) we need to create own bot and /start him
        2. crate a new chat, or use own old, and add new bot to it as the admin with all permission
        3. connection (using term end telegram chat):

             (term) >>> pip install telegram-send

             (term) >>> telegram-send --configure

                    "token request"

             (term) >>> *TOKEN

                    "received activate code" -> ***** (5 numbers)

             (own telegram chat) >>> ***** (enter activate code)

                    "ðŸŽŠ Congratulations fesenkoaa! ðŸŽŠ
                     telegram-send is now ready for use!"

        TELEGRAM BOT WAS ADDED AND READY TO SEND MESSAGE

        4. how to use (write in working file.py):

            import telegram_send

            def send_order(order_description: str):
                telegram_send.send(messages=[order_description])


        NOW WE CAN IMPORT THIS FUNCTION AND USE IT IN FUTURE


3) CASE: setting of stripe (payment system):
